MAGIC Grants has offered its Undergraduate Cryptocurrency Scholarship program since 2019. Our scholarship is often the first time that the student is rewarded for their passion in cryptocurrencies.

MAGIC Grants is fundraising for the $6,000 that we issue annually. Three undergraduate student recipients will receive $2,000 each at the beginning of the Fall 2025 academic year.

Help us continue this program that rewards students for being passionate about cryptocurrencies!
