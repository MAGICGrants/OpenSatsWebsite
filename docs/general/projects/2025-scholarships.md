MAGIC Grants has offered its Undergraduate Cryptocurrency Scholarship program since 2019. Our scholarship recipients have gone to work for Coinbase and other cryptocurrency companies.

MAGIC Grants is fundraising the $6,000 that we issue annually. Three undegraduate student recipients will receive $2,000 each at the beginning of the Fall 2025 academic year.

Help us continue this program that rewards students for being passionate about cryptocurrencies!
