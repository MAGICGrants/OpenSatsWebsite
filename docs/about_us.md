# MAGIC Monero Fund Request for Research Proposals

## Mission  

The MAGIC Monero Fund is offering a grant program to support actionable Monero research, especially research relating to privacy, security, user experience, and efficiency. Proposals can be related to the Monero protocol directly, or they can be related to other areas of the Monero ecosystem.  

## Target Research Areas

We are interested in Monero's [open research questions](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/94), along with the following:

- Security proofs around Monero's existing constructions
- Arithmetic-circuit-based membership proofs, specifically ones without a trusted setup based on battle-tested cryptographic assumptions

While the above topics are especially encouraged, the Fund is open to funding other topics as well.

The proposal's chance to be approved will be increased if it also helps support one or more of the additional mission areas of the MAGIC Monero Fund: Development, Security (including audits); Critical Infrastructure; Community Building and Community Infrastructure; Interoperability; Feature Enhancements; Efficiency Improvements; Educational Materials.  

## Funding Amount  

The MAGIC Monero Fund anticipates funding requests of the equivalent of 5,000 to 20,000 USD at this time.  

## Deadline  

The MAGIC Monero Fund accepts applications on a rolling basis. Applications will be notified of the committee's vote on approval within three weeks of submission except in extraordinary circumstances.
