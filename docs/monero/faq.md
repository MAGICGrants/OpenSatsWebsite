# FAQ

## What is the mission statement of the Monero Fund?

- We are a committee of a 501(c)(3) public charity that funds Monero-related open source software, research and associated educational initiatives.


## How are funds distributed?

- Donations to the **general fund** are disbursed by our committee as needs arise. For projects listed on our site, we review and approve submissions carefully to ensure donated funds are positively impacting the Monero ecosystem. To hold researchers and developers accountable, payment schedules are aligned with approved project milestones.


## How much of my donation goes towards individuals and projects supported by the Monero Fund?

- We set up campaigns to closely match the amount needed to pay these individuals and projects. There are some credit card processing fees and other related fees that we try to estimate. Typically, we add a buffer of 3% to the project campaign to account for these.
- If there are any proceeds are retained by the MAGIC Monero Fund, and will be used on related projects.
- If a campaign fails to raise the full amount of funds, then the committee will work with the intended recipient to revise the scope of the project, or the raised funds will be used on related projects.

## Can an individual or project be funded by both the Monero Community Crowdfunding System (CCS) and the Monero Fund?

- Yes. There is no expectation of exclusivity, but a proposer cannot raise funds elsewhere for the exact same work that a MAGIC Monero Fund proposal is intended to cover. This allows a proposer to maintain multiple, simultaneous funding options, so long as the scope of work included in the proposal is unique.

## Do you distribute grants in Monero, Bitcoin or fiat?

- We distribute grants in the currency of the researchers choosing. We prefer to pay in XMR but will gladly distribute funds in BTC, USD, or other crypto or fiat currencies that are highly liquid.

## How do you collect Monero donations?

- We use BTCPay Server to receive all cryptocurrency donations. For fiat donations, we leverage Stripe Payments.

## Can you provide the view key to verify the Fund's incoming Monero donations?

- Yes. You can create a view-only Monero wallet with this information:
