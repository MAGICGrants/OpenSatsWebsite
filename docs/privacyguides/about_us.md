# About the MAGIC Privacy Guides Fund

[**Privacy Guides**](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/) is a socially motivated website that provides information for protecting your data security and privacy. We are a non-profit project with a mission to inform the public about the value of digital privacy, and about global government initiatives which aim to monitor your online activity. The Privacy Guides website is free of advertisements and not affiliated with any of the listed providers.

Privacy Guides is built by volunteers and staff members around the world. All changes to our recommendations and resources are reviewed by at least two [trusted](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/u?group=team&order=solutions&period=all) individuals, and we work diligently to ensure our content is updated as quickly as possible to adapt to the ever-changing cybersecurity threat landscape.

In addition to our core team, [many other people](about/contributors.md) have made contributions to the project. You can too! We're open source on GitHub, and accepting translation suggestions on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/privacyguides).

Privacy Guides is fiscally hosted by MAGIC Grants, a 501(c)(3) public charity.
